fooFighter 1000 - MIDI Controller
==========

Simple Code for 4x4 button grid and Arduino
- Uses a multi-dimensional array to correspond with the 4x4 button grid
- Serial begins in 31250 for MIDI

Notes
- Accelerometer code is there, just need to hook it up correctly
- I haven't had the time to update this because of school and work (it's been a whole year) but I'm hoping to get along with it soon!
